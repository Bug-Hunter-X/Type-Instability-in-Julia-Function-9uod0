# Julia Type Instability Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type instability issue in Julia. The `myfunction` function exhibits unexpected behavior when dealing with negative inputs due to the inconsistent return type.

## Bug Description

The `myfunction` function calculates the square of its input, returning a positive value for positive inputs, zero for zero, and the negative of the square for negative inputs. However, this leads to type instability because the return type varies depending on the input value (Int64, Float64).

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.jl` file using the Julia REPL.
3. Observe the output; you may encounter type instability warnings or unexpected results.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.jl` addresses type instability by ensuring that the return type is consistent regardless of the input. This is achieved by using explicit type annotations or by converting the return value to a common type.
